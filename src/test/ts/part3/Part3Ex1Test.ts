        This actually brings up a very important point - the window of time
        between when setup is called and when the init event is fired is one you
        need to be very careful during. Even though the editor exists, most of
        its APIs and features won't work until after initialisation is finished.

        For some use-cases, specifying init_instance_callback is more useful.
