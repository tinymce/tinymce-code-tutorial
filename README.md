# TinyMCE Code Tutorial

This repo is a tutorial in some of the programming concepts and libraries that we use in TinyMCE. We'll be covering a bunch of topics, including:

 - Functional Programming and how it applies to TinyMCE
 - Coding style and practices
 - Libraries we use for common tasks like DOM manipulation

# Getting started

You'll need installed:

 - nodejs LTS
 - yarn
 - a suitable IDE

*Clone this repo* to your own GitHub account and work through the exercises. Most of the exercises involve you filling in the blanks and running tests. We'll be writing some tests and using some external tools, too.

Anything with a TODO is something you need to fill in.

When you're finished a section, let your tutor know and they will review your code.

# Tips

Follow the types.

We do things a bit differently here, so keep an open mind.

Be patient as you learn, give it a shot, but don't be afraid to ask for help.
